## Data Preprocessing practice
This repository contains the solutions for essential data preprocessing techniques. The lab covers various methods for cleaning, transforming, and preparing datasets for machine learning algorithms.

### Project Tasks:
Task 1: Clean a dataset by removing duplicate rows and handling missing values based on a specified threshold.

Task 2: Impute missing values in different columns using mean, median, and mode imputation techniques.

Task 3: Apply Min-Max Scaling, Z-Score Normalization, and Robust Scaling to numerical features.

Task 4: Calculate BMI from height and weight and categorize individuals into different weight classifications.

Task 5: Perform one-hot encoding on a categorical feature after grouping rare categories into an "Other" category.

Task 6: Apply target encoding with smoothing to a categorical feature to account for categories with few observations.

#### Skills Obtained:
- Data Cleaning
- Missing Value Imputation
- Data Scaling and Normalization
- Feature Engineering
- Categorical Feature Encoding

This lab provides a foundational understanding and practical application of crucial data preprocessing steps, which are essential for building robust and accurate machine learning models.
